## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use css grid layout's which are somewhat specific on mobile devices. I also learned how to change color of SVGs using CSS.


### Continued development

In future project's I would like to work more on sites in which css grid is desirable.

### Useful resources

- [SVG Color](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to change color of SVG image. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
